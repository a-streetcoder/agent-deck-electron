# Agent Deck Cross-Platform — Final Parity Audit (Slice 23)

**Date:** 2026-07-22
**Scope:** Electron app audited against (a) the
[native macOS Agent Deck Swift app](https://github.com/a-streetcoder/agent-deck)
and (b) the adopted t3code feature set (Phases 4–11).

---

## Executive verdict

The cross-plat port is **substantially at parity on the load-bearing core of every area**, but it is **NOT fully at parity**. The Loop structure blocker found by the original audit is closed:

- **Loop structure alignment:** Maker+Checker, Agent Pipeline, report-only Parallel Agents, Discovery/Triage, and Human Approval now have dedicated typed orchestration rather than a single-agent fallback.
- **A band of major gaps** where whole native sub-surfaces are absent or half-built: agent **avatars** and the **per-project agent-assignment matrix**; the skills **import preview/selection sheet** and **folder-scan local import**; per-message **fork / rerun / fork-as-agent-chat** in sessions; the **semantic-memory abstain gates** and **"Memory Recalled" transcript card**; MCP **add-http / edit / OAuth auto-capture / per-project assignment** and Issues **reply / reopen / rich Open-in-Pi context**; provider **API-key sign-in** and the **session-independent model catalog**; Doctor **in-app pi install/update** and the **Web Access card**; preview **element inspector**; and desktop **background-session notifications + badge**.
- **A long tail of minor/cosmetic gaps** that are mostly documented, deliberate reductions.

The t3code-adopted set (terminal, diffs, review comments, open-in-editor, file nav, command palette, composer, checkpoints, preview, desktop notifications) is the **most complete and internally coherent** part of the port — fully wired end-to-end with dedicated e2e specs — and its remaining gaps are almost all documented deferrals rather than broken wiring.

**Bottom line:** the happy paths work end-to-end and are tested, but the port is not yet feature-complete against the native spec. Remaining Loop work is workflow depth such as launch context and review/apply/discard, not missing structure engines.

## Per-area summary

### macOS-parity areas

**Agents** — Core CRUD, builtin diff-override + reset, rename with default re-point, enable/disable, TOCTOU-safe writer, and the four-scope sectioned list are all present. Gaps: the entire **avatar system** is absent (only a scope-tinted paperplane glyph, `AgentAvatar.tsx:28-42`); the **per-project agent-assignment matrix** (built for skills/prompts, never applied to agents) and **per-project builtin disable** are missing; a swath of **subagent-config fields** (defaultExpectedOutcome, defaultProgress, interactive, output, defaultReads, maxSubagentDepth) can't be edited; editor UX uses free-text comma inputs vs native live pickers.

**Skills** — The git-repo pipeline (source parsing, persistent clone + provenance, ls-remote check, ff update, Keep-Mine/Take-Remote) genuinely works. Gaps: the native **import sheet with per-skill selection** is entirely absent (cross-plat force-imports every skill from one URL); **local import only accepts a single `.md`** (no folder scan, assets dropped); **conflict detection is SKILL.md-hash-only**, so edits to reference files are silently overwritten on update (a data-loss gap).

**Prompts + scopes/assignment** — Full CRUD, global-vs-project scoping with global-first resolution, per-project + All-Projects assignment, and slash-command insertion are ported and e2e-tested. Gaps are all in the richer native discovery model: no Library / Builtin(+disable) / Package / Settings sections, no search box, argument-hint frontmatter is preserve-only (uneditable), and no import-external-prompt path.

**Sessions / transcripts / fork / resume** — Lifecycle (create with worktree isolation, resume with history+plan restore, rename, delete-with-cleanup, merge, search, live state) is solid; the transcript reducer renders streaming/thinking/tool/subagent/supervisor faithfully. Biggest gap: **fork collapses to a whole-file "Duplicate" at HEAD** — no per-message fork via pi `/fork`, no **rerun (edit-and-resend)**, no **fork-as-agent-chat**, no provenance/recap card, no per-message copy/fork buttons.

**Worktrees + merge + Git incl. release** — Strong parity: worktree create, review-then-merge (idle-gated), status/commit/push, AI commit-message, and the generalized Release action (preflight → AI notes → atomic tag-and-push with rollback) all track the native services. Gaps are secondary: session-delete keeps the branch (native force-deletes), no keepWorktreeAfterMerge toggle, no explicit pre-merge parent-clean guard, merge conflict collapses to a generic 409, release preflight drops the remote-sync (ahead/behind) gate.

**Loops** — Loop Bank CRUD and dedicated Maker+Checker, Agent Pipeline, report-only Parallel Agents, Discovery/Triage, and Human Approval orchestration are present with structure-specific configuration and durable evidence. Remaining gaps include launch context, complete worktree review/apply/discard, visible session/transcript integration, project availability/assignment, and builtin loops.

**Memory** — Strong core: project-scoped store, all types/statuses with injection eligibility, secret scanning, launch + per-turn injection, the three bridge tools, and a lexical+fuzzy recall that correctly abstains. Gaps: the **semantic embedder path lacks native's abstain/qualification gates** (injects top-N for any query); there is **no "Memory Recalled" transcript card** and no click-through from memory cards; the data model drops useCount/lastUsedAt; UI drops tags editing, detail view, bulk stale cleanup, and the pause toggle.

**MCP + Issues** — Happy path covered (list servers with live status + tools, add stdio, refresh, remove, http OAuth; issues list with facets, detail, close). Gaps: MCP **add is stdio-only** (no http via UI, so OAuth is unreachable normally), **no edit**, **OAuth uses manual paste-the-code against a dead loopback port** (`mcpLoopback.ts` is unwired dead code), **no per-project assignment**. Issues: **no reply/comment posting, no reopen**, one-line Open-in-Pi vs native's rich `<github-issue-context>`, no relationships, thinner detail pane.

**Doctor + Onboarding + Provider login** — Doctor probe (exceeds native by adding node/bash preflights), phased onboarding, and the interactive OAuth relay are production-quality and tested. Gaps: providers are **OAuth-only — no API-key sign-in** and most providers (OpenAI/Google/OpenRouter/Groq/xAI/…) can't be added in-app; **no session-independent model catalog** (Models screen + onboarding picker empty until a session exists); Doctor lacks in-app **pi install/update + auto-update toggle** and the **Web Access (Exa/url-fetch) card**.

### t3code-adopted areas

**Set A (terminal, diffs+review-comments, open-in-editor, file nav, command palette)** — The most complete part of the port; all five fully wired with dedicated e2e specs and one unified command catalog. Remaining gaps are documented deferrals: no side-by-side split diff (stale docstring pointer), transcript file-reference open deferred and never picked up, no syntax highlighting (deliberate, no shiki/workers), single terminal per session, and a few parked a11y items.

**Set B (preview + automation, composer, checkpoints, desktop polish)** — Core flows present and tested (dev-script preview with loopback-only sandboxed embed, composer pending-input/review/element/file surfaces, per-turn checkpoints with idle-gated rollback, S22a native turn-complete notifications + badge). Real gaps: preview automation is a **manual CSS-selector subset** (no click-to-select inspector, no screenshot annotation) because the cross-origin iframe forbids in-frame injection; and desktop attention is **scoped to the active session only** — a background session finishing raises neither a notification nor a badge.

## Recommended fix-slices (non-parked, ordered by severity)

**Slice A — Loops workflow depth.** Preserve the five dedicated structure engines while adding launch context, richer per-iteration artifacts, worktree review/apply/discard, visible session/transcript integration, missing control-bar actions, and project availability/assignment.

**Slice B — Provider + model reach.** Add API-key sign-in (write `ApiKeyCredential` to auth.json) and surface the full connectable provider catalog (Subscriptions + API-key groups). Introduce a session-independent model catalog endpoint so the Models screen and onboarding default-model picker work before a session exists.

**Slice C — MCP completeness.** Add http/remote server add + edit forms, wire the dead `McpLoopbackServer` so OAuth auto-captures the redirect (kill the paste-the-code UX), and add per-project MCP assignment. Fold in per-tool descriptions, master toggle, config-source coverage, and read-only/reveal.

**Slice D — Issues write-back + context.** Add comment posting and reopen routes/UI, and build the rich `<github-issue-context>` block for Open-in-Pi (body + comments + relationships). Consider moving from gh-CLI to REST to unlock relationships, issue type, state-reason, and permalinks.

**Slice E — Agents avatars + assignment matrix.** Ship the portable "Import from File" + stored-image display path (AgentImageStore/AgentImageLoader), the per-project agent-assignment matrix and per-project builtin disable (reuse the skills/prompts pattern already in the codebase), and add the missing subagent-config editor fields.

**Slice F — Sessions fork/rerun.** Implement per-message fork via pi `/fork` (cut point + composer seed + provenance/recap), in-place rerun (edit-and-resend), and the per-message hover copy/fork gutter buttons.

**Slice G — Memory recall fidelity.** Port native's semantic abstain/qualification gates (minTopSimilarity, keepScoreRatio, discriminative-term overlap) and add the "Memory Recalled" transcript card with click-through to the Memory screen.

**Slice H — Doctor actionability.** Add in-app pi install/update with progress + auto-update toggle, the Web Access card (Exa key + url-fetch deps), the GitHub connect button, and the Settings Files viewer.

**Slice I — Skills import UX + safety.** Build the fetch-and-preview import sheet with per-skill selection, folder-scan local import (with assets), and upgrade conflict detection to per-file fingerprinting so reference-file edits aren't silently overwritten (closes a real data-loss gap).

**Slice J — Desktop background attention.** Track all sessions (not just the active one) for turn-complete/approval, fix the badge to count distinct sessions-awaiting-review, and wire the `focus-session` IPC in the renderer so clicking a notification navigates to the raising session.

**Slice K — Minor/polish sweep.** Preview element inspector improvements (or accept the manual subset), diff split view + syntax highlighting, transcript file-reference open, worktree cleanup/guards, prompts library/search/builtin, and the remaining minor items batched by area.
