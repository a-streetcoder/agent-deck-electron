/**
 * Agent Deck Memory — durable, project-scoped knowledge stored as inspectable
 * Markdown (see https://github.com/a-streetcoder/agent-deck/blob/main/agent-deck-documentation/memory.md). This package is the
 * cross-platform store: creation, retrieval, and the write guards. The native
 * app's on-device NLContextualEmbedding recall is macOS-only, so retrieval
 * starts lexical (term-overlap over title/summary/tags) — the same corrective
 * signal the native app blends in — with a JS on-device embedder to follow.
