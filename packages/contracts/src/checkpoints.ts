/**
 * Checkpoints wire contract (Slice 18a — CAPTURE + list, server-only). A
 * checkpoint of turn N is the pair {conversation snapshot, workspace snapshot}
 * captured at the idle turn-boundary (see docs/checkpoints-design.md): pi's
 * session file copied wholesale + the working tree captured as a HIDDEN git ref.
 * This surface is the READ side only — `checkpoints_list` — riding
 * `RpcClientFrame` alongside the diff/terminal/file op families. Rollback and the
 * timeline UI are Slice 18b; capture is landable on its own because it is inert
 * until something restores.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *   - `CheckpointInfo` is the CLIENT-facing projection of a checkpoint record:
 *     the per-turn index, when it was captured, a short human label (the turn's
 *     first user message), and whether the workspace half was captured
 *     (`hasFiles: false` for a non-git session — the checkpoint then carries only
 *     the conversation snapshot). The on-disk record (server-internal:
 *     snapshot path, git ref, cwd, source-file identity) never crosses the wire.
 *   - The retained list is bounded server-side to {@link CHECKPOINT_MAX_RETAINED}
 *     per session (oldest pruned first); the wire list is capped to match.
